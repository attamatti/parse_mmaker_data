USAGE: parse_mmaker_data.py <log copied from chimera> <subunit name> <color maximum>

log copied from chimera is copied from the replylog after running a series of commands likt those in mmaker_template.txt

the other .txt files are examples of these logs.

color maximum is optional - this sets the maximum value used for setting the colors of the correlation matrix - this is useful if you want several matrices to be on same color scale despite different maximum values.  If this is left blank the maximum for that specific dataset is used.
